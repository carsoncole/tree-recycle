%h1 About

%p The Bainbridge Island tree recycle event is a community service and fundraiser for BSA Scout Troop 1564 for boys and Troop 1804 for girls. Make a tree pickup reservation, and on the day of pickup, we will pickup your tree and compost it. We accept a donation for this service, which will be used to support the Scout program of our two Troops.
